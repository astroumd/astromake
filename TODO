- prevent packages being loaded multiple times
- allow tailoring, e.g. if gipsy needs a LD_LIBRARY_PATH on
  certain machines
	DONE:  use $ASTROMAKE/.astromake
- clean up versioning (status vs. opt/VERSIONS) 
- turn verbosity off (ASTROLOADED ?)


- don't do anything if the version requested doesnt' exist ???

- figure out why -v doesn't work 1st time on grus

- make dependancies, something that make should be good at.
  e.g. if nemo was compiled with a certain compiler,
	astroload nemo
  should do 
	astroload -v 3.2.2 gcc
  if that is what it was used with....
