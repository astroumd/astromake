- prevent same package being loaded multiple times
- allow tailoring, e.g. if gipsy needs a LD_LIBRARY_PATH on
  certain machines
	DONE:  use $ASTROMAKE/.astromake
- clean up versioning (status vs. opt/VERSIONS) 
- turn verbosity off (ASTROLOADED ?)

- how about an 'astrounload'

- add infrastructure to build packages from tar balls (ala
  carma_tools)

- don't do anything if the version requested doesnt' exist ???

- figure out why -v doesn't work 1st time on grus

- make dependancies, something that make should be good at.
  e.g. if nemo was compiled with a certain compiler,
	astroload nemo
  should do 
	astroload -v 3.2.2 gcc
  if that is what it was used with....

- incremental loads ??   allow multiple versions of astromake?

- allow packages to be loaded that don't have a status file?

- write the rc scripts in a meta-shell, that gets compiled in the 
  various shells that we want to support.  This way we could
  envision more bash and sh support.
  For some packages multi-shell support is done internally
  (e.g. NEMO, MIRIAD, Karma) which makes this approach not as
  useful

- when loading a package, if that package depends on another package,
  it should also be loaded....

- mac?
