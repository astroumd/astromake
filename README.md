# astromake
building and managing packages and optionally multiple versions

This set of scripts allows you to manage loading packages in your unix shell, much like the module command. After
installation users would be able to use commands such as

astroload casa

astroload -i casa

astroload -v 5.5.2 casa

To load a default, query versions or load a specific version of the casa package.
