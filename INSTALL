First time install via github:
    git clone https://github.com/astroumd/astromake
    cd astromake
    ./configure
    make install
    source astromake_start.sh


    astroload miriad nemo
    astroload -v 1.5 aips++

Cheating:

 * in $ASTROMAKE/opt you can symlink to 'astromake' (or even other) packages 
   that live someplace else in your filesystem.
   Usually you have to brand a fake status file in $ASTROMAKE/status/package_name, 
   link them in $ASTROMAKE/opt/package_name.

==

Adding a package manually:

  1) add it in $ASTROMAKE/opt/<name>
     or
               $ASTROMAKE/opt/<name>/<version>
               $ASTROMAKE/opt/<name>/VERSIONS
     when you also maintain a simple VERSIONS text file

  2) make sure you have a default version id in $ASTROMAKE/status/<name>, e.g.

	echo 2.3 > $ASTROMAKE/status/foo

  3) make sure your package has client script(s) in $ASTROMAKE/rc/<name>.csh
     and <name>.sh for the two major Unix shell flavors
